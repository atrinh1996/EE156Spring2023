1: Mechanics in Quantum Systems
- Why do we care about QM? In short, Moore's Law.

- Transistors on computers are now on the scale of 7 - 10 nm, and are expected to get smaller. For ref. a silicon atom is about .2 nm. 

- In quantum systems at the nanometer scale, particles (like atoms, light waves, electrons) exhibit different physical properties than we are used to. 

- And through a phenomenon like quantum tunneling (or teleportation), electrons can pass through the very thin layer of a transistor. Since Logic gates control electric currents through circuits, tunneling can lead to leakages.

- These are some physical limits on how small the technology can get and still be expected to function correctly






2: QPUs
- So Quantum Computing looks to exploit quantum mechanical properties through hardware to design exponentially more efficient computing devices and solve problems not feasibly solvable on just classical computers, such as simulating quantum mechanics.

- But The idea is not for QCs to replace classical computers, but to have Quantum Processor Units be accelerators or co-processors to our CPUs.

3: Bits and Qubits
- How is computation expected to work?

Quantum:
- On quantum computers, information is stored on qubits (or quantum bits); atoms or ions, or superconducting devices (also called artificial atoms) that are integrated on quantum chips.

- This is the Bloch Sphere Model 3D representation of qubit. The idea is that for a point that falls on or within the sphere, it represents the probability distribution of the states the qubit could be in, this is referring to superposition. 

- Superposition allows qubits to represent many combinations of 0s and 1s at the same time, and so they can go through numerous computational outcomes at once. Entanglement describes correlations between quantum particles, so information about and work on one qubit correlates to those on other entangled qubits. 

- So Every qubit essentially doubles the computational space.

- Some Challenges to the control and manipulation of qubits include the sensitivity to noise (interactions with the environment), and qubit decoherence (the loss of information), which is a natural occurrence from spontaneous loss of energy. 

- But thats not to say qubit design is impossible. 

- In a reference to Moore's Law about transistors, a physicist named Robert Schoelkopf observed that superconducting qubit decoherence can be delayed by a factor of 10 every 3 years, i.o.w. improvement on the lifetime of a qubit in a quantum state is exponential.

4: Quantum Circuit Model
- Because quantum systems are fragile, reading qubits (also calle measurement), collapses them out of quantum state in to their single classical definite value. 

- The idea is that we want to control them such that a readout of qubits yields a desired outcome with high probabilty. 

- When talking about states, they are represented in this bracket notation. 

- With a bit, it can be in either the 0 or 1 state with equal probabilty. 

- But with qubits, their state, represented by Psi, is a probability distribution of the possible states, so we speak about it in terms of the amplitudes (alphas) of the bit-strings (b's).





5: Example QCM
- This is comparison of the normal boolean logic gates we are used to (this is an XOR gate), next to quantum circuit (this is creating a two-qubit entanglement and their measurings). (Hadamard and CNOT gates)
